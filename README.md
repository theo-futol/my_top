# my_top

**my_top** is an EPITECH project from the Unix Shell Programming unit. The goal is to reproduce the top command that lists processes and informations on your system.

## Objectives

The project is entirely coded in C with the ncurses library, so make sure to have it installed.

The whole standard C library was authorized except functions like system, exec, execve..., getloadavg or any functions retrieving process or system informations for us. The main goal was to make our way through the /proc filesystem to find, parse and display the right informations.

## Usage

```
make
./my_top
```
